When Git users want to switch branches without facing an error, they need to save the current working and repository indexes. For this purpose, the Git command “git stash” is utilized to save the repository’s current work and repository working index in the stash file. However, the Git command “git stash pop” is utilized to pop out the saved content. When the Git user moves back to the main branch and wants to continue the work, the “git stash pop” or “git stash apply” command can be utilized.
